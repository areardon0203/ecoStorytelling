            <h2>American Eel</h2>
<h4>CATCH AND RELEASE ONLY</h4> 
            <p>The American Shad is the largest of Connecticut herring species. They spend most of their adult lives at sea and return to the river at the birth of their spawn. The American Shad swam farther upstream than any of the other herring. In the Connecticut river the shard have migrated as far north as Bellows Falls in Vermont. Some adult shad migrate back out to sea after spawning but the stress is great and it's common to see dead shad during the late spring. Young shad spend the summer and fall in the rivers and migrate to the oceans in the late fall. 
<h3>How to identify The American Shad</h3>        
            </p>The American Shad is a Gray or Bluish green on its back and silver on its sides, with white on its belly, they have a dark spot on their shoulders sometimes followed by several others. Their mouth is larger than other herrings( It goes from the end of the jaw to the middle of its eye!) compared to juveniles whose snout is slightly more pointed than other herring. They are around 15 to 24 inches. The Connecticut state record was 25.8 inches and was 9.3 pounds! If you catch an American Shad make sure to release it!
