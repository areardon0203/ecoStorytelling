            <h2>American Eel</h2>
<h4>Season-Year-round</h4>  
            <p>The American Eel is a primarily nocturnal eel. They can be found almost anywhere along the West Indies and all the way along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Greenland south, sometimes as far south as Brazil. They can be found inland in the United States from the Great Lakes, Mississippi Drainage and parts of Texas. They are common in lakes, streams or ponds closer to the coast but they prefer to hide under cover and out of the current. The American Eel is Connecticut's only species that spends most of its adult life in freshwater, but they spawn in salt water. All American Eels spawn in an area in the Western Atlantic Ocean called the Sargasso sea, which is the same sea as the Bermuda Triangle.
