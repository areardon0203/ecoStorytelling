        <h2>Redfin Pickerel</h2>
        <p>Redfin Pickerel are one of the many native species of Pickerel and Pike in Connecticut. They are the smallest species of pike in Connecticut and are commonly confused for small chain pickerel by anglers. They may compete or have different habitats compared to chain pickerel but are most common where chain pickerel are rare. Redfin Pickerel occasionally hybridize with chain pickerel and the characteristics are intermediate between the two species. Redfin pickerel are commonly 5 to 9 inches but the max size they were reported at was 15.3 inches! They can be found along the atlantic coastal states( new hampshire to florida). They prefer vegetated backwaters of streams and small ponds, but other species of Pickerel are found in the connecticut river.
